Welcome to this repository

This is a dash web app that displays the AQI analysis project done by Munkh-Erdene Khuderbaatar and Sungjun An during our Data Science Senior Year project class at San Jose State University.

We did San Joaquin Valley AQI data analysis and machine learning development in Google Colab, and then added the results in this web app. 

For deployment, we hosted our app on Google App Engine (Standard), and we also stored some datasets, models, and other data in Google Cloud Storage. 

During this project, we learned to effectively build Dash apps, Google Cloud Platform (especially App Engine and Google Cloud Storage), advanced real life Data Analytics, and advanced Machine Learning Development.

Thank you.
